Decision Tree : 
is a machine learning algorithm (supervised learning)
whereas clustering (unsupervised learning)

machine learning : it is a branch of AI and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way the 
humans learn, gradually improving it's accuracy.

root node (Decision Node) : Represents entire population 
this is the point where the population gets divide into 2 or more groups 

internal node : Like a root node but it does not contain the entire population we further divide our data into more groups 
from here 

leaf node : it is the one that Represents the final outcome 


from the images given we can understand that students sleeping less than 8 hours and if the exam time is in the morning they fail 
here decision is made on the basis of the number of hours the student sleep 

how do we split the data 

for this we have something known as attribut selection meaasures (ASM)
it is used for selecting and spliting criteria that splits the data in the best possible manner 
it provides rank to each feature by explaining the given datasheet 
the feature with the best rank gets selected as the spilting attribute

it starts building a tree structure by repeating this process recursively for each child (internal node) 
until reaches the final outcome (leaf Node)
